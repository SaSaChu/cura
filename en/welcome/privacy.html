            </p>
            <p class='p02'>How we use information we collect</p>
            <p class='p01'>
              We use the information we collect from all of our services to provide, maintain, protect and improve them, and to develop new ones. We’ll neither sell nor rent your personal information to anyone.
              <br/><br/>
              We only share your personal information listed in the personally identifiable form with third parties described below:
            </p>
            <p class='p03'>Affiliated Businesses (not controlled by Cura) :</p>
            <p class='p04'>
              In certain situations, our affiliated businesses may sell items or provide services to you (either by themselves or jointly with us). For example, when we sell products or provide services jointly with affiliated businesses, you will recognize when an affiliated business is associated with such a transaction or service, in that case, we will share your personal information with that affiliated business only to the extent that it is related to such transaction or service. We may share non-personally identifiable information (such as anonymous usage data, referring/exit pages and URLs, platform types, number of clicks, etc.) with interested third parties to help them understand the usage patterns for certain Cura services.
            </p>

            <p class='p03'>Advertisers:</p>
            <p class='p04'>
              We may allow advertisers to choose the demographic information of users who will see their advertisements and we may provide information we have collected from you to an advertiser in non-personally-identifiable form, so the advertiser can select the appropriate audience for its advertisements.
            </p>
            <p class='p03'>Agents:</p>
            <p class='p04'>
              When we employ other companies and people to perform tasks on our behalf, we will need to share your information with them to provide products or services to you. However, unless we tell you differently, our agents do not have any right to use any personal information we share with them beyond what is necessary to assist us. For example, if you were to engage in a credit card transaction, we would need to allow a credit card processing company to verify the transaction; however, that company would only be authorized to use your credit card information to the extent we needed their assistance in completing your transaction.
            </p>
            <p class='p03'>User Profiles and Submissions:</p>
            <p class='p04'>
              As you must understand that we cannot control what other users do with any content you voluntarily disclose on the service.

            </p>
            <p class='p03'>Protection of Cura and Others:</p>
            <p class='p04'>
              We may release personal information when we believe in good faith that release is necessary to comply with the law; enforce or apply our conditions of use and other agreements; or protect the rights, property, or safety of Cura, our employees, our users, or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection and credit risk reduction.
            </p>
            <p class='p03'>With Your Consent:</p>
            <p class='p04'>
              Except from mentioned above, we’ll share your personal information with third parties when we have your consent to do so.

            <p class='p01'>
              Your account is protected by a password for your privacy and security. However, in order to prevent unauthorized access to your account and personal information, it’s important to select and protect your password appropriately and also to limit access to your computer and browser by signing off after you have finished accessing your account.

              We strive to protect the privacy of your account and personal information we have in our records, but a complete security cannot be guaranteed. Unauthorized entry or use, hardware or software failure, and other factors, may still compromise the security of user information at any time.
