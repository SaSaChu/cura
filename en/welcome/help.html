            <p class='p02 p02_h'>HOW DOES RING™ VIDEO DOORBELL WORK?</p>
            <p class='p01'>
              Ring Video Doorbell connects to your home Wi-Fi network and sends real-time notifications to your smart phone or tablet when someone is at your door. Using our free Ring App which is available for Apple, Android, and Windows 10 devices, you can see an HD Video stream of the person at your door and speak to them using two-way audio communication. Ring Doorbell can alert you when someone presses the button on your doorbell or when motion is detected. Ring Doorbells operate on battery power or hooked up to your home doorbell wiring.
            </p>

            <p class='p02 p02_h'>HOW BIG IS RING DOORBELL?</p>
            <p class='p01'>
              Ring Doorbell is 4.98 x 2.43 x 0.87 inches, 12.65 x 6.17 x 2.21 cm.
            </p>

            <p class='p02 p02_h'>HOW DOES RING™ VIDEO DOORBELL WORK?</p>
            <p class='p01'>
              Ring Doorbell can operate wirelessly using its built-in battery. You also have the option of connecting your Ring Doorbell to your home’s existing doorbell wiring.
            </p>

            <p class='p02 p02_h'>DOES RING REQUIRE POWER WIRES TO WORK?</p>
            <p class='p01'>
              Yes - you'll receive email reminders when your battery runs low. The Ring app also features a low-battery warning, as well as a battery level indicator that you can check at any time.
            </p>

            <p class='p02 p02_h'>WILL I BE NOTIFIED WHEN THE BATTERY IN MY RING DOORBELL IS LOW?</p>
            <p class='p01'>
              Ring Video Doorbell connects to your home Wi-Fi network and sends real-time notifications to your smart phone or tablet when someone is at your door. Using our free Ring App which is available for Apple, Android, and Windows 10 devices, you can see an HD Video stream of the person at your door and speak to them using two-way audio communication.

            <p class='p02 p02_h'>ARE THERE ANY ADDITIONAL FEES INVOLVED?</p>
            <p class='p01'>
              All Ring devices will operate without an additional fee or subscription. However, we offer optional Ring Video Recording Plans that cost a monthly or yearly subscription fee. Without Ring Video Recording, you will still receive alerts when visitors press your Doorbell or trigger the motion sensors in your device, and you’ll still get live streaming video and two-way audio, so you can see, hear and speak to guests in real-time, as the event is happening. However, if you don’t have Ring Video Recording and you miss an alert or a live event, you will not be able to review the video. Ring Video Recording will save all of your recordings to your Ring account for up to 60 days, and with Ring Video Recording, you can also review the videos, download them to local storage, and share them via social media, text and email. There are two options for Ring Video Recording: Basic and Protect. Basic costs $3 per month or $30 for the year per device; Protect costs $10 per month or $100 for year, and it covers an unlimited amount of Ring cameras, offers a lifetime product warranty and gives you an additional 10% off future purchases at Ring.com.

            <p class='p02 p02_h'>WHAT IF SOMEONE STEALS MY RING DOORBELL?</p>
